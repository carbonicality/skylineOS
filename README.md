# SkylineOS
## About SkylineOS
SkylineOS is a webOS (an operating-system-like interface thats in a browser) that I coded in HTML, CSS, and JS, which I created for the Hackclub Summer of Making event. 
I hope to make it feature Linux support via v86, and basic app integration,
so that I can make app files with their own file extension. SkylineOS' design is inspired from SerenityOS and GRUB, and its commands are inspired by UNIX.

## What I learnt from this project
- how to import fonts that arent on google fonts (lol)
- how to make things like context menus
- how to be better at javascript

## NOTE:
If you want to use v86 functionality, you will have to use a local server to host it.
If you have python3, you can:
`git clone` this GitHub repo, cd into it, and run `python3 -m http.server 8080` and then go to: `http://localhost:8080/bootloader.html` to run this.
