# SkylineOS
## About SkylineOS
SkylineOS is a webOS (an operating-system-like interface thats in a browser) that I coded in HTML, CSS, and JS, which I created for the Hackclub Summer of Making event. 
SkylineOS features working Alpine Linux support via v86.
SkylineOS' design is inspired from SerenityOS and GRUB, and its commands are inspired by UNIX.

## What I learnt from this project
- how to import fonts that arent on google fonts (lol)
- how to make things like context menus
- how to be better at javascript
- how to use v86

## NOTE:
If you are not using the Vercel link (https://skyline-os.vercel.app/desktop.html), or any other dynamic hosting platform, and want to use the v86 functionality, you can use this project locally using python3 and git clone.
Step 1:
`git clone https://github.com/carbonicality/skylineos`
Step 2:
`cd <path to skylineos directory>`
Step 3:
`python3 -m http.server 8080`

You will then be able to use this project and use v86!
